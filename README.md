## About reconPoint

reconPoint is a game-changing reconnaissance suite. It has turbocharged features for security professionals, penetration testers, and bug bounty hunters. It includes:

- Advanced scan engines
- Data correlation
- Continuous monitoring
- GPT-powered Vulnerability Reports
- Project management with role-based access control

🦾 reconPoint performs end-to-end reconnaissance, from subdomain discovery to vulnerability scanning. It supports WHOIS identification, WAF detection, and more, making it a go-to tool for efficient reconnaissance.

🗃️ reconPoint integrates with a database, providing seamless data correlation and organization, allowing you to filter reconnaissance data effortlessly.

🔧 Highly configurable, reconPoint uses a YAML-based configuration system, offering customizable scan engines for all types of recon.

💎&nbsp;&nbsp;Subscans: Subscan is a game-changing feature in reconPoint, setting it apart as the only open-source tool of its kind to offer this capability. With Subscan, waiting for the entire pipeline to complete is a thing of the past. Now, users can swiftly respond to newfound discoveries during reconnaissance. Whether you've stumbled upon an intriguing subdomain and wish to conduct a focused port scan or want to delve deeper with a vulnerability assessment, reconPoint has you covered.

📃&nbsp;&nbsp; PDF Reports: In addition to its robust reconnaissance capabilities, reconPoint goes the extra mile by simplifying the report generation process, recognizing the crucial role that PDF reports play in the realm of end-to-end reconnaissance. Users can effortlessly generate and customize PDF reports to suit their exact needs. Whether it's a Full Scan Report, Vulnerability Report, or a concise reconnaissance report, reconPoint provides the flexibility to choose the report type that best communicates your findings. Moreover, the level of customization is unparalleled, allowing users to select report colors, fine-tune executive summaries, and even add personalized touches like company names and footers. With GPT integration, your reports aren't just a report, with remediation steps, and impacts, you get 360-degree view of the vulnerabilities you've uncovered.

🔖&nbsp; &nbsp; Say Hello to Projects! reconPoint 2.0 introduces a powerful addition that enables you to efficiently organize your web application reconnaissance efforts. With this feature, you can create distinct project spaces, each tailored to a specific purpose, such as personal bug bounty hunting, client engagements, or any other specialized recon task. Each projects will have separate dashboard and all the scan results will be separated from each project, while scan engines and configuration will be shared across all the projects.

⚙️&nbsp; &nbsp; Roles and Permissions! In reconPoint 2.0, we've taken your web application reconnaissance to a whole new level of control and security. Now, you can assign distinct roles to your team members—Sys Admin, Penetration Tester, and Auditor—each with precisely defined permissions to tailor their access and actions within the reconPoint ecosystem.

- 🔐 Sys Admin: Sys Admin is a superuser that has permission to modify system and scan related configurations, scan engines, create new users, add new tools etc. Superuser can initiate scans and subscans effortlessly.
- 🔍 Penetration Tester: Penetration Tester will be allowed to modify and initiate scans and subscans, add or update targets, etc. A penetration tester will not be allowed to modify system configurations.
- 📊 Auditor: Auditor can only view and download the report. An auditor can not change any system or scan related configurations nor can initiate any scans or subscans.

🚀&nbsp;&nbsp; GPT Vulnerability Report Generation: Get ready for the future of penetration testing reports with reconPoint's groundbreaking feature: "GPT-Powered Report Generation"! With the power of OpenAI's GPT, reconPoint now provides you with detailed vulnerability descriptions, remediation strategies, and impact assessments that read like they were written by a human security expert! **But that's not all!** Our GPT-driven reports go the extra mile by scouring the web for related news articles, blogs, and references, so you have a 360-degree view of the vulnerabilities you've uncovered. With reconPoint 2.0 revolutionize your penetration testing game and impress your clients with reports that are not just informative but engaging and comprehensive with detailed analysis on impact assessment and remediation strategies.

🥷&nbsp;&nbsp; GPT-Powered Attack Surface Generation: With reconPoint 2.0, reconPoint seamlessly integrates with GPT to identify the attacks that you can likely perform on a subdomain. By making use of reconnaissance data such as page title, open ports, subdomain name etc. reconPoint can advise you the attacks you could perform on a target. reconPoint will also provide you the rationale on why the specific attack is likely to be successful.

🧭&nbsp;&nbsp;Continuous monitoring: Continuous monitoring is at the core of reconPoint's mission, and it's robust continuous monitoring feature ensures that their targets are under constant scrutiny. With the flexibility to schedule scans at regular intervals, penetration testers can effortlessly stay informed about their targets. What sets reconPoint apart is its seamless integration with popular notification channels such as Discord, Slack, and Telegram, delivering real-time alerts for newly discovered subdomains, vulnerabilities, or any changes in reconnaissance data.

## Quick Installation

### Quick Setup for Ubuntu/VPS

1. Clone the repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/khulnasoft/reconpoint && cd reconpoint
   ```

1. Configure the environment

   ```bash
   nano .env
   ```

   **Ensure you change the `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` for security.**

1. (Optional) For non-interactive install, set admin credentials in `.env`

   ```bash
   DJANGO_SUPERUSER_USERNAME=yourUsername
   DJANGO_SUPERUSER_EMAIL=YourMail@example.com
   DJANGO_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD=yourStrongPassword
   ```

   If you need to carry out a non-interactive installation, you can setup the login, email and password of the web interface admin directly from the .env file (instead of manually setting them from prompts during the installation process). This option can be interesting for automated installation (via ansible, vagrant, etc.).

   - `DJANGO_SUPERUSER_USERNAME`: web interface admin username (used to login to the web interface).

   - `DJANGO_SUPERUSER_EMAIL`: web interface admin email.

   - `DJANGO_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD`: web interface admin password (used to login to the web interface).

1. Adjust Celery worker scaling in `.env`

   ```bash
   MAX_CONCURRENCY=80
   MIN_CONCURRENCY=10
   ```

   `MAX_CONCURRENCY`: This parameter specifies the maximum number of reconPoint's concurrent Celery worker processes that can be spawned. In this case, it's set to 80, meaning that the application can utilize up to 80 concurrent worker processes to execute tasks concurrently. This is useful for handling a high volume of scans or when you want to scale up processing power during periods of high demand. If you have more CPU cores, you will need to increase this for maximised performance.

   `MIN_CONCURRENCY`: On the other hand, MIN_CONCURRENCY specifies the minimum number of concurrent worker processes that should be maintained, even during periods of lower demand. In this example, it's set to 10, which means that even when there are fewer tasks to process, at least 10 worker processes will be kept running. This helps ensure that the application can respond promptly to incoming tasks without the overhead of repeatedly starting and stopping worker processes.

   These settings allow for dynamic scaling of Celery workers, ensuring that the application efficiently manages its workload by adjusting the number of concurrent workers based on the workload's size and complexity.

   Here is the ideal value for `MIN_CONCURRENCY` and `MAX_CONCURRENCY` depending on the number of RAM your machine has:

   - 4GB: `MAX_CONCURRENCY=10`
   - 8GB: `MAX_CONCURRENCY=30`
   - 16GB: `MAX_CONCURRENCY=50`

   This is just an ideal value which developers have tested and tried out and works! But feel free to play around with the values.
   Maximum number of scans is determined by various factors, your network bandwidth, RAM, number of CPUs available. etc

1. Run the installation script:

   ```bash
   sudo ./install.sh
   ```

   For non-interactive install: `sudo ./install.sh -n`

   _Note: If needed, run `chmod +x install.sh` to grant execution permissions._

**reconPoint can now be accessed from <https://127.0.0.1> or if you're on the VPS <https://your_vps_ip_address>**

**Unless you are on development branch, please do not access reconPoint via any ports**
